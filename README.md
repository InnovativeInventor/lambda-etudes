## Lambda-etudes
Inspired from: https://github.com/norvig/pytudes

"An *Ã©tude* (a French word meaning *study*) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, 
of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular 
musical skill." &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude)

This project is intended to derive common lambda calculus functions from the ground up with automatic testing (with QuickCheck) and Haskell's excellent type system.
Designed to be readable to non-Haskellers familiar with lambda calculus.

[`etudes.hs`](/etudes.hs) contains all the preliminary etudes.

## Running Tests
To run tests, load [`etudes.hs`](/etudes.hs) into `ghci` and run `runTests` like so:

``` haskell
>>> :l etudes.hs
>>> runTests
```

Sample output:

``` shell
